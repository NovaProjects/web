# Welcome

Oh hi! [AeroClient](https://www.github.com/aero-ware/aeroclient) is AeroWare's powerful, robust Discord.js framework.

It focuses mainly on flexibility and efficiency, but wait, how is AeroClient any different from Commando, Akairo, or any other Discord.js framework?

**AeroClient has many options and includes middleware, along with many other utility classes and functions.**

We'll go over each of these in detail in the next couple of pages.

_For now, think of AeroClient as a stretchy gummy bear!_

### Prerequisites

To use AeroClient, you'll obviously need to know Discord.js fairly well, so if you haven't yet, please check out the [official guide](https://discordjs.guide/) or [Nova's](/guides/discord.js/welcome).

### Dependencies

AeroClient uses [ms](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ms) and [date-fns](https://www.npmjs.com/package/date-fns) to format numbers into readable formats.

AeroClient also employs [keyv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyv) to persist data if you want to. This includes:

-   @keyv/mongo
-   @keyv/mysql
-   @keyv/postgres
-   @keyv/redis
-   @keyv/sqlite

### Extra

AeroClient works really well with [TypeScript](http://typescriptlang.org/). If you'd like to give TypeScript a try, you should take a look at our TypeScript guide!

AeroClient comes with two utility packages, [@aeroware/logger](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aeroware/logger), and [@aeroware/discord-utils](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aeroware/discord-utils).

-   **@aeroware/logger** – A really nice and minimal logger with 4 simple functions.
-   **@aeroware/discord-utils** – Amazing Discord.js utility functions to ease your life.
